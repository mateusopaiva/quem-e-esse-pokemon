## 📂 Description
This project is inspired by the famous game "Who's That Pokémon?" and was originally developed in C# by instructor Jeniffer Bittencourt (<a href="https://github.com/jeniblodev/quem-e-esse-pokemon">Original project</a>). The proposal was reformulated to Python, with the goal of showcasing the programming language, demonstrating how to consume an API, and exploring the use of libraries like NumPy in a creative and fun way.

The project was developed during a live coding session with students on Alura's Discord, where we explored the Pokémon API by creating an interactive guessing game. This content is ideal for those who have a basic understanding of programming and want to practice using APIs while creating an interesting project for their portfolio.
